# octopusdeploy_team (Resource)

This resource manages teams in Octopus Deploy.

~> **NOTE on Team User Roles and Scoped User Roles:** We currently
provides both a standalone [Scoped User Role resource](scoped_user_role.html)
and a Team resource with `user_roles` blocks defined in-line. At this time you 
cannot use a Team with in-line user_roles in conjunction with any Scoped User Role 
resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of user role settings and will overwrite 
user roles.
